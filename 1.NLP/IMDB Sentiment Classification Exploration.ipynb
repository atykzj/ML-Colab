just brilliant casting location scenery story direction everyone's really suited the part they played and you could just imagine being there robert redford's is an amazing actor and now the same being director norman's father came from the same scottish island as myself so i loved the fact there was a real connection with this film the witty remarks throughout the film were great it was just brilliant so much that i bought the film as soon as it was released for retail and would recommend it to everyone to watch and the fly fishing was amazing really cried at the end it was so sad and you know what they say if you cry at a film it must have been good and this definitely was also congratulations to the two little boy's that played the part's of norman and paul they were just brilliant children are often left out of the praising list i think because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big profile for the whole film but these children are amazing and should be praised for what they have done don't you think the whole story was so lovely because it was true and was someone's life after all that was shared with us

in russia the film is broken into five parts men and maggots drama on the an appeal from the dead the odessa steps and meeting the squadron br br eisenstein was a revolutionary artist but at the genius level not wanting to make a historical drama eisenstein used visual texture to give the film a newsreel look so that the viewer feels he is eavesdropping on a thrilling and politically revolutionary story this technique is used by the battle of algiers br br unlike eisenstein relied on or the casting of non professionals who had striking physical appearances the extraordinary faces of the cast are what one remembers from potemkin this technique is later used by frank capra in mr deeds goes to town and meet john doe but in potemkin no one individual is cast as a hero or heroine the story is told through a series of scenes that are combined in a special effect known as montage the editing and selection of short segments to produce a desired effect on the viewer d w griffith also used the montage but no one mastered it so well as eisenstein br br the artistic filming of the crew sleeping in their is complemented by the graceful swinging of tables suspended from chains in the galley in contrast the confrontation between the crew and their officers is charged with electricity and the clenched fists of the masses demonstrate their rage with injustice br br eisenstein introduced the technique of showing an action and repeating it again but from a slightly different angle to demonstrate intensity the breaking of a plate bearing the words give us this day our daily bread signifies the beginning of the end this technique is used in last year at marienbad also when the ship's surgeon is tossed over the side his nez dangles from the rigging it was these glasses that the officer used to inspect and pass the maggot infested meat this sequence ties the punishment to the corruption of the czarist era br br the most noted sequence in the film and perhaps in all of film history is the odessa steps the broad expanse of the steps are filled with hundreds of extras rapid and dramatic violence is always suggested and not explicit yet the visual images of the deaths of a few will last in the minds of the viewer forever br br the angular shots of marching boots and legs descending the steps are cleverly accentuated with long menacing shadows from a sun at the top of the steps the pace of the sequence is deliberately varied between the marching soldiers and a few civilians who summon up courage to beg them to stop a close up of a woman's face frozen in horror after being struck by a soldier's sword is the direct antecedent of the bank teller in bonnie in clyde and gives a lasting impression of the horror of the czarist regime br br the death of a young mother leads to a baby carriage careening down the steps in a sequence that has been copied by hitchcock in foreign correspondent by terry gilliam in brazil and brian depalma in the untouchables this sequence is shown repeatedly from various angles thus drawing out what probably was only a five second event br br potemkin is a film that the revolutionary spirit celebrates it for those already committed and it for the unconverted it seethes of fire and roars with the senseless injustices of the decadent czarist regime its greatest impact has been on film students who have borrowed and only slightly improved on techniques invented in russia several generations ago\""]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":77}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ORC4zRcZNOyJ"},"source":["**Taking a
